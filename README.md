# Hot Restaurant App

## DESCRIPTION

This was a team project that was broken down into IV phases of development.  Together, we built a basic app demonstrating Node and Express with jQuery. Overall purpose is to help schedule reservation requests. Restaurant has just 5 tables available. First five requests get a reservation, every request after that is sent to the waiting list.

## Work Phases

**Phase I: **
```
Backend team creates Express server. | Front end team works on the three html files.
```
**Phase II: **
```
Backend team works on API Routing (create objects to hold table & waitlist; create routes to get/put data).
Front end team works with backend team to coordinate the routes to the web pages they will be serving.
```
**Phase III: **
```
Backend team creates the logic to handle reservation requests. Use Postman for testing.
Front end team researches how ajax calls work to do GET & POST requestes.
Then create code in tables.html to retrieve data from backend via GET
Then create code in reserve.html to send data to the backend via POST.
```
**Phase IV: **
```
Run and debug app.
```

## Project Management

**Distributed coding approach**

I served as the "Benevolent GitHub Dicatator," or BGD for this project.  I was designated to create a HotRestaurantsApp repository on GitHub and to be the Project Manager to proof, resolve conflicts, and merge commits to the master branch. 
```
Each team member pulled from this repository & created their own working branch.
Once a member finishes a chunk of work, they pushed the GitHub repo & request a merge.
I, as the BGD, merged pull requests as quickly as possible.
Then, each team member did a git pull & git merge master when master branch changes.
